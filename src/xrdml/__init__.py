That is the whole of it. Nothing is downloaded, nothing is opened twice, and
nothing about the file's layout has to be known first: the trees say which
rows are for training and which class each of them is, the columns say which
is the picture and which the answer, and every minibatch is a read of one
basket out of the file wherever it lives.

What a batch holds is decided the way a person would decide it. Every input
column becomes one ``(rows, features)`` block of ``float32``, side by side if
there are several; a column of bytes is a picture, so it is divided by 255
into the nought-to-one that networks expect; and the answer comes back as
whole numbers for a classifier or as floats for a regression, because that is
what the loss functions of each take. Pass ``scale=False`` to be handed the
numbers exactly as the file holds them.

This module is the friendly face of :mod:`xrdml.tensors`, which is where the
tensors are actually made and where to go for control over any of it.
PyTorch is not imported until a batch is asked for, so a file can be opened,
described and read here on a machine that has no framework installed at all.

    :attr:`Config.catalogue`, which defaults to the ScotGrid AI catalogue
    and is overridable with the ``XRD_CATALOGUE`` environment variable. It is
    the ``index.json`` an ``xrd-datasets`` site serves; that is how the second
    line above finds the same file as the first.
    A catalogue dataset split into physical ROOT shards requires
    ``split="train"`` (or another split named in its index entry); this keeps
    a multi-gigabyte logical dataset streamable without an ambiguous default.

    The columns to learn from and the one to learn are worked out from their
    names - see :class:`Dataset` - and ``inputs`` and ``answer`` say so
    outright when a file's names are its own.

    ``cache=True`` pulls the file to :attr:`Config.cache_dir` first and
    opens it from there, so the network is paid once and every run afterwards
    is a local read - see :func:`download`, of which this is the shorthand.
    Pass a directory instead of ``True`` to say where. It is off by default
    because streaming is the point: a training loop reads the baskets it wants
    and never the whole file, so a cache only earns its keep when the same
    dataset is read over and over, or read where the network is worse than the
    disk.

    The dataset holds the file open. Use it in a ``with`` block, or let it go
