"""The same MNIST classifier as ``mnist_mlp.py``, in the words a beginner has.

There are no baskets, offsets or dtypes here: a URL goes in, minibatches of
``(images, labels)`` come out, and the file stays on the server throughout.
Everything else - which trees are the training rows, which column is the
picture and which the answer, how much to hold at once, what to divide the
bytes by - is read off the file by :mod:`xrdml` and can be printed.

    $ python -m xrd.testing datasets --port 21094 --pattern 'mnist.root'
    $ python examples/mnist_easy.py root://127.0.0.1:21094//mnist.root

``mnist_mlp.py`` is this same program written against :mod:`xrdml.tensors`, one
layer down, for when the reading itself is what needs changing.
