"""An MLP that learns MNIST off a ``root://`` URL, a basket at a time.

Nothing is downloaded first and nothing is held: every minibatch is a read of
one basket out of the file on the server. The line at the end says how much of
the file was in this process at the widest moment, counted by ``tracemalloc``,
which sees the reading but not PyTorch's own arenas.
